# node-gyp-opencv

> Most basic example of adding a OpenCV C++ add-on to node.js

This example will help you to to get started with your computer vision project by static linking OpenCV 3.4 with [Native Abstractions for Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/nan). Includes "opencv_contrib" so SIFT and SURF are available

## Usage

```
npm run build:opencv
cd packages/client
npm install
npm start
```

## SIFT becomes free

U.S. patents are valid for 20 years from the earliest filing date, but can be extended to 21 years if a Priority Date is used, and SIFT ([US6711293B1](https://patents.google.com/patent/US6711293B1/en)) was filed (with priority) on 1999-03-08. This means that usage of the SIFT algorithm is no longer requires a license for use.
